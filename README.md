**2. Mailing Expense Details**
```
line# 145 :         self.mail_sender('<mailidhere@gmail.com>',  #set you mail ID here
...
...
line# 154 :            smtpObj.login(sender, '<passwordhere>')  #set your password
```

Once you set your mail ID credentials and you set mail ID appropriately while adding new users, you'll be able to alert the end users via EMAILs as well.
